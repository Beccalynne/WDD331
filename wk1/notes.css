/* Setting html- height: 100% will have it fill the page and then you can adj height on individual rules */
/* VH - View hieght - similar to making it the whole screen --- Another way to set browser window(viewport) instead of adjusting HTML
VW - View width
Vmin - depends on the smallest */

/* font size you can go 1.2em, makes it a little larger because resolutions have 
changed over time and making the font pixel smaller -- if set in html tag sets base/reference point */

/* rem - absolute; em - relative and build sizes off eachother */

/* 
@media screen and (min-width: 700px)
min width- when min width exeeds 700 px - when the screen gets bigger
max width - when the screen gets smaller

Only include what needs to change, don't copy and paste the original rule
Pace media query at the end of your CSS file --- heirarchy

Use as many break points as you need, when design looks broken at a break point and redesign
